# *Simulated Enterprise Environment (Before Migration)*

Overview

To simulate the infrastructure of an existing company, we designed a fictional enterprise environment called SecureCo. This environment replicates the systems, data, and workflows of a small-to-medium-sized business and serves as the baseline for our cloud migration project.

Company Details
	‚Ä¢	Name: SecureCo
	‚Ä¢	Industry: Financial Services or E-Commerce
	‚Ä¢	Infrastructure Challenges:
	‚Ä¢	Hosting systems and applications on local servers.
	‚Ä¢	Limited security measures to protect sensitive data.
	‚Ä¢	Inefficient or outdated file-sharing systems.

Simulated Infrastructure Components

1. Servers
	‚Ä¢	Simulated Environment: Virtual Machines (VM) or Docker containers hosted locally.
	‚Ä¢	Setup Details:
	‚Ä¢	A web server (using Nginx or Apache) to host a basic application.
	‚Ä¢	A database server (using MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store company data.
	‚Ä¢	A directory service (optional) to simulate an Active Directory for user management.

2. Applications
	‚Ä¢	Internal Web Application:
	‚Ä¢	A simple internal application for managing employees, customers, or products.
	‚Ä¢	Built with HTML, CSS, and a backend framework like Flask or Django.

3. File Sharing System
	‚Ä¢	NAS Simulation:
	‚Ä¢	A shared file system for employees, implemented using Nextcloud.
	‚Ä¢	Hosted locally via a Docker container or VM to mimic enterprise-level file sharing.

4. Data
	‚Ä¢	Fictitious datasets for testing, including:
	‚Ä¢	Employee records.
	‚Ä¢	Customer data.
	‚Ä¢	Transactional or financial data.

Cloud Migration Plan

The migration plan consists of transferring the on-premise environment to a secure cloud infrastructure and implementing best practices for security governance.

Migration Steps

1. Cloud Infrastructure Setup
	‚Ä¢	Set up a secure cloud environment using AWS Free Tier, Azure Free Tier, or Google Cloud Platform.
	‚Ä¢	Key components:
	‚Ä¢	Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Define secure subnets and networking.
	‚Ä¢	Compute Instances (EC2): Deploy the application and database.
	‚Ä¢	Storage (S3): Use secure storage for files and data.
	‚Ä¢	IAM Policies: Create fine-grained access controls for all resources.

2. Application Migration
	‚Ä¢	Migrate the local application to a cloud-hosted instance (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2).
	‚Ä¢	Integrate the application with a cloud-hosted database (AWS RDS).

3. File System Migration
	‚Ä¢	Replace the NAS with cloud-based storage like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
	‚Ä¢	Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit.

4. Security Governance
	‚Ä¢	Define security policies for access control, encryption, and compliance with standards like GDPR.
	‚Ä¢	Use cloud governance tools (e.g., AWS Config, Azure Policy) to enforce these rules.

5. Monitoring and Incident Response
	‚Ä¢	Deploy a SIEM solution (e.g., Wazuh, ELK Stack) for log collection and monitoring.
	‚Ä¢	Simulate incidents (e.g., unauthorized access) and create an incident response plan.

Deliverables
	1.	Simulated Environment Documentation:
	‚Ä¢	Description of the infrastructure setup before migration.
	‚Ä¢	Architecture diagrams of the on-premise environment.
	2.	Migration Documentation:
	‚Ä¢	Step-by-step guide for migrating the infrastructure to the cloud.
	‚Ä¢	Diagrams showing the architecture after migration.
	3.	Security Policies:
	‚Ä¢	Detailed security governance framework, including IAM policies, encryption rules, and compliance measures.
	4.	SIEM and Monitoring Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Logs, dashboards, and incident reports created during the monitoring phase.
	5.	GitHub Repository:
	‚Ä¢	Source code, configurations (e.g., Terraform files), and documentation for reproducing the project.

This version is formatted to fit perfectly within a README.md file and covers all the information you‚Äôll need to explain the simulated environment and the migration process. Let me know if you‚Äôd like further refinements!

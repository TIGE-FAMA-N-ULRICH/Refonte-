# üîí **Secure Chatroom with End-to-End Encryption**  

---

## üìñ **Project Overview**  

This project aims to develop a **secure chatroom platform** that ensures **privacy** and **confidentiality** through **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**. Users can exchange messages in real-time, with all data encrypted and decrypted **locally on their devices**. The platform simulates a real-world secure communication system by focusing on:  
- **Data security**  
- **Identity management**  
- **Reliable encryption protocols**  

---

## üéØ **Objectives**  

1. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   - A web-based chat platform with a simple and intuitive design.  
   - Secure login and registration with **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.  

2. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**:  
   - Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted only on the recipient's device.  
   - The server never has access to private keys or plaintext messages.  

3. **Real-Time Communication**:  
   - **Sockets** for instant messaging.  
   - Secure communication using **SSL/TLS protocols**.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - A design prepared for future enhancements, including hybrid cloud deployment.  

---

## ‚ú® **Key Features**  

1. **Secure User Registration**:  
   - Users provide basic details (name, email, username, and password).  
   - A script (`client.py`) generates **private and public keys** locally on the user's device.  

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:  
   - An additional layer of security ensures user identity verification during login.  

3. **Encrypted Messaging**:  
   - Messages are encrypted using the recipient's **public key** before being sent.  
   - Only the recipient can decrypt the messages using their **private key**.  

4. **SSL/TLS Secured Connections**:  
   - Communication between clients and the server is secured with SSL/TLS.  

5. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**:  
   - Accessible via web browsers through secure HTTPS URLs or domain names.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Stack**  

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)  
- **Encryption Library**: `PyCryptodome` or equivalent  
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL for user management  
- **Sockets**: Python `socket` library for real-time messaging  
- **Security Protocols**: SSL/TLS certificates for transport security  

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Structure**  

1. **Authentication Module**:  
   - Secure user registration and login with MFA.  
   - Local key generation using the `client.py` script.  

2. **Chatroom Module**:  
   - Real-time communication using sockets.  
   - Fully encrypted messaging system.  

3. **Server-Side Security**:  
   - SSL/TLS for secure transport.  
   - No private key storage on the server.  

4. **Future Extensions**:  
   - Migration to a hybrid cloud for scalability.

## üìÖ **Project Milestones**  

### **Phase 1: Planning and Design**  
- Define user stories and project requirements.  
- Create system architecture and data flow diagrams.  

### **Phase 2: Development**  
- Build user registration and login modules with MFA.  
- Implement local key generation and encrypted messaging.  
- Set up socket-based real-time communication.  

### **Phase 3: Testing and Security Validation**  
- Verify encryption and decryption processes.  
- Conduct security audits to ensure data protection.  

### **Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment**  
- Prepare GitHub documentation and user guides.  
- Deploy the system locally or on a test server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**  

1. **User Registration**:  
   - Users register with their details.  
   - A local script (`client.py`) generates **private and public keys**.  
   - The **public key** is sent to the server, while the **private key** remains secure on the user's device.  

2. **User Login**:  
   - MFA verifies user identity during login.  
   - Successful login grants access to the chatroom.  

3. **Messaging**:  
   - Messages are encrypted with the recipient's **public key** and sent to the server.  
   - The server temporarily stores the encrypted message until it is delivered.  
   - The recipient decrypts the message locally using their **private key**.

# Secure Chatroom with End-to-End Encryption

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a secure chatroom platform that ensures privacy and confidentiality for its users through **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**. The system will allow users to exchange messages in real-time, with their data encrypted and decrypted only on their devices. The project is designed to simulate a real-world secure communication platform, focusing on **data security**, **identity management**, and **reliable encryption protocols**.

## **Objectives**
1. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   - Provide a simple and intuitive web-based chat platform for users.
   - Support secure login and registration processes, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

2. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**:  
   - Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted only on the recipient's device.
   - Ensure the server has no access to private keys or plaintext messages.

3. **Real-Time Communication**:  
   - Implement real-time messaging using **sockets**.
   - Use SSL/TLS protocols to secure communication between clients and the server.

4. **Scalability**:  
   - Design the system to support future enhancements, including migration to a hybrid cloud environment.

## **Key Features**
1. **Secure User Registration**  
   - Users must register using their name, email, username, and password.  
   - A script (`client.py`) will be downloaded during registration to locally generate **private and public keys**.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   - An extra layer of security will be added during login to verify user identities.

3. **Encrypted Messaging**  
   - All messages are encrypted using public keys before being sent to the server.  
   - Only the intended recipient can decrypt messages using their private key.

4. **SSL/TLS Secured Connections**  
   - All communication between clients and the server will be secured with SSL/TLS certificates.

5. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**  
   - Users can access the platform through a web browser via a secure HTTPS URL or domain name.

## **Technical Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python (with Flask or Django)  
- **Encryption Library**: `PyCryptodome` or equivalent  
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL for user management  
- **Sockets**: Python `socket` library for real-time communication  
- **Security Protocols**: SSL/TLS certificates for transport layer security

## **Project Structure**
1. **Authentication Module**  
   - Secure user registration and login with MFA.  
   - Local generation of private/public keys using the downloaded `client.py` script.

2. **Chatroom Module**  
   - Real-time communication using sockets.  
   - End-to-end encryption for all messages.  

3. **Server-Side Security**  
   - SSL/TLS to secure communication.  
   - No storage of private keys on the server.

4. **Future Extension**  
   - Migration to a hybrid cloud environment to support scalability and enhanced reliability.

## **Project Milestones**
1. **Phase 1: Planning and Design**  
   - Define user stories and project requirements.  
   - Create diagrams for system architecture and data flow.

2. **Phase 2: Development**  
   - Develop user registration and login modules with MFA.  
   - Implement key generation and management.  
   - Build the chatroom with socket-based real-time communication.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Security Validation**  
   - Test encryption and decryption processes.  
   - Conduct security audits to ensure data protection.

4. **Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment**  
   - Prepare documentation for GitHub and user guides.  
   - Deploy the system on a local or test environment.

## **How It Works**
1. **User Registration**:  
   - The user fills in a registration form with basic details.  
   - A file (`client.py`) is downloaded to their device, generating private and public keys locally.  
   - The public key is sent to the server, while the private key remains on the user's device.

2. **User Login**:  
   - Users log in with MFA for added security.  
   - Upon successful login, they gain access to the chatroom.

3. **Messaging**:  
   - Users send messages that are encrypted using the recipient's public key.  
   - The server stores the encrypted messages temporarily until they are delivered.  
   - Only the recipient can decrypt the messages using their private key.

# 🔐 **Secure Chatroom with MFA as an Independent Service**

---

## 📖 **Global Workflow and Directory Structure**

### **Overview**  
This implementation separates the **MFA** system as an independent service, ensuring each application component has a well-defined responsibility.  

---

### **Suggested Directory Structure**  

1. **Frontend**  
   - Contains the code for the user interface built with **React** and **Vite**.  
   - Interacts with the backend for chat functionalities and with the **MFA Service** for authentication.  
   - **Example Structure**:  
     ```plaintext
     /frontend
       ├── src/
       ├── public/
       └── package.json
     ```  

2. **Backend (Chatroom)**  
   - Manages sockets, message storage, and server-side logic.  
   - Interacts with a database for user and message management.  
   - **Example Structure**:  
     ```plaintext
     /backend
       ├── app.py (or main.py)
       ├── sockets/
       ├── api/
       ├── utils/
       └── requirements.txt
     ```  

3. **MFA Service**  
   - Operates as a fully independent authentication service.  
   - Provides REST endpoints for registration, login, and MFA verification.  
   - Maintains its own database for user authentication data.  
   - **Example Structure**:  
     ```plaintext
     /mfa-service
       ├── src/
       │   ├── routes/
       │   ├── controllers/
       │   ├── models/
       └── package.json
     ```  

4. **Database**  
   - Two separate databases:  
     - One for user authentication and MFA (handled by the MFA Service).  
     - One for messages and chatroom-related data (handled by the backend).  

---

## 🌐 **Server Setup**

### **Initial Phase: Local Machine Deployment**

1. **Number of Servers**  
   - **1 Server for Backend (Chatroom)**: Hosts messaging logic (Python-based).  
   - **1 Server for MFA Service**: Manages user authentication and security (JavaScript-based).  
   - **1 Server for the Database (Optional)**: If resources are limited, databases can be hosted on the backend or MFA servers.  

2. **Service Locations**  
   - **Frontend (React/Vite)**: Hosted locally or served statically via the backend.  
   - **MFA Service**: Accessible locally via a specific IP or port (e.g., `http://192.168.0.x:3000`).  
   - **Backend Chatroom**: Connects to the MFA Service via its API and manages users/messages.  

---

### **Long-Term Phase: Cloud Migration**

1. **Hosting**  
   - **MFA Service**: Deployed on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) as an independent service.  
   - **Backend and Frontend**: Hosted together or separately based on scalability needs.  
   - **Database**: Migrated to a managed cloud database service (e.g., AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas).  

2. **Interaction Flow**  
   - **Frontend → Backend → MFA Service**:  
     - Frontend handles user inputs and sends requests to the backend.  
     - Backend interacts with the MFA API for authentication-related operations.  

---

## 🛠️ **MFA and Database Management**

### **Short-Term Plan (Local Setup)**  
- The **MFA Service** and its database are hosted locally, handling:  
  - User emails  
  - MFA tokens  
  - Public/private key pairs  

### **Long-Term Plan (Cloud)**  
- Host the MFA Service independently on the cloud.  
- Database options:  
  - Keep it embedded in the MFA Service for autonomy.  
  - Share it with the backend for centralized user management.  

---

## 🔄 **Workflow Example: MFA Integration**

### **1. User Registration**  
- The frontend sends registration details to the backend.  
- The backend calls the **MFA Service API** to create the user.  
- The MFA Service generates a token and returns it to the backend.  

### **2. User Login**  
- The frontend submits login credentials to the backend.  
- The backend validates credentials with the MFA Service and retrieves a session token.  
- Upon validation, the user accesses the chatroom.  

### **3. Messaging**  
- Logged-in users can send messages encrypted on the client side.  
- Messages are transmitted to the backend via sockets.  
- The backend temporarily stores messages until delivery.  

---

## 🖥️ **Example Implementation**

### **Backend Interaction with MFA Service (Python)**  
```python
import requests

# Example: User Login via MFA Service
def login_user(email, password):
    url = "http://192.168.0.x:3000/api/login"
    payload = {
        "email": email,
        "password": password
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Returns token or user details
    else:
        raise Exception("Login failed")
```

## 🔐 **Important Considerations**

1. **Service Communication**  
   - Use IP addresses or domain names to connect services.  
   - Ensure required ports are open and properly configured.  

2. **Security**  
   - Implement **SSL/TLS** for secure communication between backend and MFA services.  

3. **Testing**  
   - Test individual components before integration.  
   - Simulate edge cases to ensure system robustness.

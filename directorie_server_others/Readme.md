# 🔐 **Secure Chatroom with MFA as an Independent Service**

---

## 📖 **Global Workflow and Directory Structure**

### **Overview**  
This implementation separates the **MFA** system as an independent service, ensuring each application component has a well-defined responsibility.  

---

### **Suggested Directory Structure**  

1. **Frontend**  
   - Contains the code for the user interface built with **React** and **Vite**.  
   - Interacts with the backend for chat functionalities and with the **MFA Service** for authentication.  
   - **Example Structure**:  
     ```plaintext
     /frontend
       ├── src/
       ├── public/
       └── package.json
     ```  

2. **Backend (Chatroom)**  
   - Manages sockets, message storage, and server-side logic.  
   - Interacts with a database for user and message management.  
   - **Example Structure**:  
     ```plaintext
     /backend
       ├── app.py (or main.py)
       ├── sockets/
       ├── api/
       ├── utils/
       └── requirements.txt
     ```  

3. **MFA Service**  
   - Operates as a fully independent authentication service.  
   - Provides REST endpoints for registration, login, and MFA verification.  
   - Maintains its own database for user authentication data.  
   - **Example Structure**:  
     ```plaintext
     /mfa-service
       ├── src/
       │   ├── routes/
       │   ├── controllers/
       │   ├── models/
       └── package.json
     ```  

4. **Database**  
   - Two separate databases:  
     - One for user authentication and MFA (handled by the MFA Service).  
     - One for messages and chatroom-related data (handled by the backend).  

---

## 🌐 **Server Setup**

### **Initial Phase: Local Machine Deployment**

1. **Number of Servers**  
   - **1 Server for Backend (Chatroom)**: Hosts messaging logic (Python-based).  
   - **1 Server for MFA Service**: Manages user authentication and security (JavaScript-based).  
   - **1 Server for the Database (Optional)**: If resources are limited, databases can be hosted on the backend or MFA servers.  

2. **Service Locations**  
   - **Frontend (React/Vite)**: Hosted locally or served statically via the backend.  
   - **MFA Service**: Accessible locally via a specific IP or port (e.g., `http://192.168.0.x:3000`).  
   - **Backend Chatroom**: Connects to the MFA Service via its API and manages users/messages.  

---

### **Long-Term Phase: Cloud Migration**

1. **Hosting**  
   - **MFA Service**: Deployed on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) as an independent service.  
   - **Backend and Frontend**: Hosted together or separately based on scalability needs.  
   - **Database**: Migrated to a managed cloud database service (e.g., AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas).  

2. **Interaction Flow**  
   - **Frontend → Backend → MFA Service**:  
     - Frontend handles user inputs and sends requests to the backend.  
     - Backend interacts with the MFA API for authentication-related operations.  

---

## 🛠️ **MFA and Database Management**

### **Short-Term Plan (Local Setup)**  
- The **MFA Service** and its database are hosted locally, handling:  
  - User emails  
  - MFA tokens  
  - Public/private key pairs  

### **Long-Term Plan (Cloud)**  
- Host the MFA Service independently on the cloud.  
- Database options:  
  - Keep it embedded in the MFA Service for autonomy.  
  - Share it with the backend for centralized user management.  

---

## 🔄 **Workflow Example: MFA Integration**

### **1. User Registration**  
- The frontend sends registration details to the backend.  
- The backend calls the **MFA Service API** to create the user.  
- The MFA Service generates a token and returns it to the backend.  

### **2. User Login**  
- The frontend submits login credentials to the backend.  
- The backend validates credentials with the MFA Service and retrieves a session token.  
- Upon validation, the user accesses the chatroom.  

### **3. Messaging**  
- Logged-in users can send messages encrypted on the client side.  
- Messages are transmitted to the backend via sockets.  
- The backend temporarily stores messages until delivery.  

---

## 🖥️ **Example Implementation**

### **Backend Interaction with MFA Service (Python)**  
```python
import requests

# Example: User Login via MFA Service
def login_user(email, password):
    url = "http://192.168.0.x:3000/api/login"
    payload = {
        "email": email,
        "password": password
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Returns token or user details
    else:
        raise Exception("Login failed")
```

---

## 🔐 **Important Considerations**

1. **Service Communication**  
   - Use IP addresses or domain names to connect services.  
   - Ensure required ports are open and properly configured.  

2. **Security**  
   - Implement **SSL/TLS** for secure communication between backend and MFA services.  

3. **Testing**  
   - Test individual components before integration.  
   - Simulate edge cases to ensure system robustness.

# 🔐 **Secure Chatroom with MFA Integration**  

---

## 📖 **Overview of Processes and Component Interactions**  

This document outlines the interactions and workflows between the components of the secure chatroom project, focusing on user registration, authentication with **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, and encrypted messaging.  

---

### **1. User Registration Workflow**  

1. **Frontend (Registration Form)**  
   - The user fills out a registration form (name, email, password, etc.).  
   - The frontend sends the data to the backend via the `POST /register` API endpoint.  

2. **Backend (Python)**  
   - Receives the registration details and forwards them to the MFA Service via `POST /mfa/register`.  
   - The MFA Service generates a **QR code** and returns it to the backend, which sends it to the frontend.  
   - The user scans the QR code using an authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator).  

3. **Client-Side Key Generation**  
   - After completing the MFA setup, the frontend triggers a script (`client.py`) to generate **private and public keys** locally.  
   - The public key is sent to the backend via `POST /register/key` and stored in the main database.  

---

### **2. User Login Workflow**  

1. **Frontend (Login Form)**  
   - The user enters their email and password to log in.  
   - The frontend sends these credentials to the backend via the `POST /login` API.  

2. **Backend (Python)**  
   - Validates the user's credentials.  
   - Sends a request to the MFA Service (`POST /mfa/verify`) to validate the user's MFA token.  
   - Upon successful validation, the user is authenticated and gains access to the chatroom.  

---

### **3. Messaging Workflow**  

1. **Message Exchange (Sockets)**  
   - Users send encrypted messages to other users via sockets.  
   - The backend manages the sockets to transmit these encrypted messages.  

2. **Message Storage**  
   - Messages are stored in the main database in encrypted form.  
   - When a recipient retrieves their messages, they are transmitted via sockets and decrypted locally.  

---

## 📂 **Component Architecture**  

### **Frontend**  
- Hosts user-facing forms (registration, login) and the messaging interface.  
- Handles key generation using `client.py`.  
- Communicates with:  
  - The **backend** for user data and chat functionalities.  
  - The **MFA Service** for authentication workflows.  

### **Backend**  
- Manages business logic, including:  
  - Communication with the database for user and message management.  
  - Interactions with the MFA Service for authentication.  
- Provides centralized APIs for the frontend.  

### **MFA Service**  
- Independent service responsible for:  
  - User registration for MFA.  
  - Generating and verifying MFA tokens.  
- Maintains its own database for storing MFA-specific user details.  

### **Database**  
- **Primary Database**:  
  - Stores user profiles (e.g., public keys) and encrypted messages.  
- **MFA Database**:  
  - Maintains MFA-specific data (e.g., emails, tokens).  

---

## 📊 **Server Requirements**

### **Minimum Configuration (3 Servers)**  

1. **Server 1**: Backend + Frontend  
   - The backend (Python) and frontend (React/Vite) are hosted together.  
   - The frontend is served statically via the backend (e.g., using Flask or Nginx).  

2. **Server 2**: MFA Service  
   - The MFA Service (JavaScript-based) runs independently to handle user authentication securely.  

3. **Server 3**: Primary Database  
   - Hosts the main database for user and message data.  

---

### **Advanced Configuration (4 Servers or More)**  

1. **Server 1**: Backend Only  
   - Handles core logic and socket communication independently.  

2. **Server 2**: Frontend Only  
   - Dedicated to serving the React/Vite frontend, optionally hosted on a CDN like Cloudflare.  

3. **Server 3**: MFA Service  
   - Remains independent for modularity and security.  

4. **Server 4**: Primary Database  
   - Dedicated to storing encrypted messages and user profiles, potentially hosted on a cloud service (e.g., AWS RDS).  

---

## 🌐 **Server Integration and Deployment**

### **Can Multiple Servers Be Used in a Single Project?**  
Yes. Each component (frontend, backend, MFA, database) functions as a service, communicating through **REST APIs** or **sockets**, regardless of being hosted on the same machine or separate servers.  

**Example**:  
- The frontend communicates with the backend via `http://backend-server-ip:5000`.  
- The backend calls the MFA Service at `http://mfa-server-ip:3000`.  

---

## 🔀 **Should Frontend and Backend Share the Same Server?**

### **Advantages of Sharing Servers**  
1. **Simplified Management**: Easier to configure and deploy.  
2. **Cost-Effective**: Requires fewer resources.  
3. **Direct Communication**: Avoids cross-server latency.  

### **Disadvantages**  
1. **Limited Scalability**: Cannot handle high loads efficiently.  
2. **Reduced Security**: A compromised server affects both frontend and backend.  
3. **Deployment Challenges**: Any update requires redeploying both parts.  

---

## 🔐 **Should MFA Service Be Independent?**

### **Advantages of a Separate MFA Service**  
1. **Modularity**: Can be reused across multiple projects.  
2. **Enhanced Security**: Isolated from other components, reducing the attack surface.  
3. **Ease of Updates**: Changes to MFA logic won’t affect other services.  

### **Disadvantages**  
1. **Increased Cost**: Requires additional resources.  
2. **Setup Complexity**: Requires secure communication setup between services.
